### Test Page Routing after login (React Router Dom)

    5.7.2020

    I had issues on frontend routing that it isn't jump to where I wanted,
    so I watched some youtube, and create this small project for route testing.

    Fortunately, the result is what I expected, the problem laid on exact path.
    I wasn't placing exact path on the route component, therefore, the it was routing to other pages.
